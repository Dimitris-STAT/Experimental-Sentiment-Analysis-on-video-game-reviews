# Overview

As the [paper]() explains Sentiment analysis plays a pivotal role in understanding customer perceptions within the 
dynamic gaming industry. In this study, we embark on an in-depth comparative analysis 
of five prominent supervised machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machines 
(SVM), Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forests, 
and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to unravel their efficacy in sentiment 
classification within video game reviews. Our research aims to provide a comprehensive 
and explanatory examination of these algorithms, shedding light on their strengths, 
weaknesses, and practical implications. By scrutinizing a diverse dataset of video game 
reviews, we assess their performance in accurately capturing nuanced sentiments, 
gauging their potential to influence data-driven decision-making. Through this 
exploration, we aim to equip stakeholders in the gaming industry with valuable insights, 
empowering them to enhance customer satisfaction, foster brand loyalty, and drive 
sustained growth. Join us in this endeavor as we delve into the intricacies of sentiment 
analysis and illuminate the path to informed decision-making within the gaming realm.
